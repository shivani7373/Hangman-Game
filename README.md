# Hangman-Game

Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time.
After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses.
The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word.

the idea of hangman is that one player thinks of a word and tells the other player how many letters it has. 
The second player repeatedly guesses letters.
If a guessed letter is in the word, the word chooser must reveal the position of every occurrence of the letter in the word.
